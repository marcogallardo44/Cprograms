This group project was a little rough because it was hard to have everyone done by 
the time we had set. As of the time i am writting this im fairly positive our group
has finished the whole project. We each took on one problem from the project, and 
then emailed the code to each other, for future knowledge. I had hoped we could have 
finished the project as a group a couple days before the project was due, so we could all
go over our codes with each other, and teach each other how it was done and how it works,
but due to the nature of group projects people were not done until last minute, so we will
have to learn the codes by ourselves on our own time. Im certain everyone spent a fair amount
of time on their code, and tried their hardest to make it work. As long as everyone finished
their part of the project, id say that it was successful.
