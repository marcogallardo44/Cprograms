We were all assigned a problem to do the first day we got the group project. 
Due to having the test come before the project was due, it was only natural
that none of the members in this group started until after the test. The group
decided that they would give marco the hard one and they would take the easiest
ones, since those are in the book. Since i was given the hard one (3) i had to 
finish it with enough time to give the person who got (4) since his is based
 off of mine. So the two days after the test i worked my butt off to make sure
he could do his part of the project. So i felt like i did what i needed to do 
for the group. Come Sunday night, the people in the group decide to barely 
start the project. Im pretty sure one of them started monday because apparently
he does not have the book/the pages to do the problem he was given. At the point
that i am writting this i have no idea if any of my group members finished their 
part of the project, i just hope they did their part.
